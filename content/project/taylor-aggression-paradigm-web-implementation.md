## Problem
The research team was interested in measuring aggression on the internet. Of course, it's not too hard to anger people on the internet (!); the challenge is to do so consistently. The Taylor Aggression Paradigm has been used to reliably induce aggression in lab settings. Thus, the problem emerged: to implement the paradigm for broader use, on the internet.

## Solution
I implemented the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, heretofore mainly administered in labs via a software package like Inquisit, as a JavaScript application for administration via Qualtrics. Data collected with two versions of this instrument are currently being used by a Michigan State research team in pursuit of a NIH grant.
